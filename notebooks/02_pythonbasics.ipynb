    "Imagine we have three players: A, B, and C. They are playing a Public Goods Game. Each has to decide how much they should contribute from their initial endowment of 10 tokens to the public pool. They keep their unallocated tokens. The total number of tokens in the pool is multiplied by 2 and then divided equally among each player.\n",
