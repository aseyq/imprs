## Recap
:::{.incremental}
* We covered group experiments where the individuals had the same role.
  
* We created `Player` fields for the individual level data and `Group` fields.

* We created a `group` function to `set payoffs` and triggered it at the waiting page by setting `after_all_players_arrive` method under our page class.
  
* Now we will see heterogenous groups where the individuals have different roles.
:::

## Group Experiments II - Heterogenous Groups {.smaller}


| Aspect                     | Homogeneous Groups        | Heterogeneous Groups                                     |
| -----------------          | ------------------     | --------                                             |
| **Pages**                  | Everybody sees every page |  Some pages might be shown to specific participants only|
| **Variables / Calculations** | Calculations are the same for everybody   | Role specific calculations might be necessary |

## Identifying Participants in a Group


* oTree already have a structure to deal with individuals roles in a group.
* `player.id_in_group`: Each player gets an integer from 1 to n as their id in group.
* ![](images/id_in_group.png){width="70%"}

## Default behavior `id_in_group` in oTree {.smaller}

:::{.center}
![](images/mtc_grouping_with_ids.png){width="50%"}
:::

* `id_in_group` stays the same as for multiple rounds by default.
* When participants use the same link (as opposed to the individual links), they will be grouped one by one.
* First 2 participants will be in group 1, next 2 in group 2, etc.


## Defining Roles
- Roles can be defined based on `id_in_group` variable of the player.


:::{.center}
![](images/mtc_grouping_with_ids_roles.png){width="70%"}
:::


## Calling players when they all have the same role
* In the Public Goods Game, our players were identical. So we could loop over players like

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
# Gets all the players and puts them in a list
players = group.get_players()

for p in players:
  do_something(p)
  p.some_attribute = some_number
  #...
  
```

## We can loop conditionally based on the id of the player

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
# Gets all the players and puts them in a list
players = group.get_players()

for p in players:

  if player.id_in_group == 1: # Trustor
    do_something(p)
    p.some_attribute = some_number

  if player.id_in_group == 2: # Trustee
    do_something_else(p)
    p.some_attribute = some_other_number
  #...
  
```

## Reaching player objects by id: `group.get_player_by_id()`


  ```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
  trustor = group.get_player_by_id(1)
  trustee = group.get_player_by_id(2)
  
  trustor.payoff = endowment - sent_amount + returned amount
  trustee.payoff = C.MULTIPLIER * sent_amount - returned_amount
  
  
  ```

## Dislaying pages conditionally for different roles
- We already know how to display pages conditionally in different rounds.

- We can do the same for different roles (id_in_group) as well.

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class PageForTrustor(Page):

    def is_displayed(player):
        return player.id_in_group == 1
    
```

# Now let's see how we can use these in a Trust Game

## Trust Game
![](images/trust_game_str.png)

- Trustor is given an endowment and can send any amount to the trustee.
- The amount sent is tripled by the experimenter.
- The trustee can send back any amount to the trustor.


## Creating a new app
1. `otree startapp trust`
2. Add it to `settings.py`.

```{.python filename="settings.py" code-line-numbers="false"}
# ...
SESSION_CONFIGS = [
    dict(
        name='trust',
        app_sequence=['trust'],
        num_demo_participants=2,
    ),
]
# ...
```
## Planning Pages
| Page         | Description                   | Shown |
| -------------| ----------------------------- |-------|
| Send         | Amount sent from P1 to P2     | P1    |
| Return       | Amount returned from P2 to P1   | P2    |
| Results      | Show Results                  | Both  |

. . .

- What about WaitPages?

## Planning Pages
| Page         | Description                   | Shown |
| -------------| ----------------------------- |-------|
| Send         | Amount sent from P1 to P2     | P1    |
| WaitForP1    |                               |       |
| Return       | Amount returned from P2 to P1   | P2    |
| WaitForP2    |                               |       |
| Results      | Show Results                  | Both  |

## Group fields

- We already know how to create group fields.
- We can also create forms for group fields.

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class Send(Page):
    form_fields = ['sent']
    form_model = 'group'
```

## Game Parameters{.smaller}
| Parameter             | Description                           | Scope     | Field/Type       |
| -------------         | ----------------------------------    | --------  | ----------       |
| PLAYERS_PER_GROUP     | (built-in) Number of players in group | Constants |                  |
| ENDOWMENT             | Initial endowment of P1               | Constants |`c()`   |
| MULTIPLIER            | The multiplier of P1's transfer to P2 | Constants |                  |
| sent           | The amount sent by P1 to P2           | Group     | **CurrencyField** |
| returned       | The amount sent back by P2 to P1      | Group     | **CurrencyField** |
| payoff                | Payoff of each player (built-in)     | Player     | **CurrencyField** |

. . .  

- Lets create those fields


## Setting Payoffs

* Now we can define our `set_payoff` function.

```{.python filename="settings.py" code-line-numbers="false"}

def set_payoffs(group):
    p1 = group.get_player_by_id(1)
    p2 = group.get_player_by_id(2)

    p1.payoff = C.ENDOWMENT - group.sent + group.returned
    p2.payoff = group.sent * C.MULTIPLIER - group.returned
```

## Using Experimental Currencies
* `settings.py` controls the parameters for currency types
```{.python filename="settings.py" code-line-numbers="false"}
# e.g. EUR, GBP, CNY, JPY
REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE = 'USD'
USE_POINTS = True

## this you should add manually
POINTS_CUSTOM_NAME = 'ECU'
```

## Triggering `set_payoffs`
| Page         | Description                   | Shown |
| -------------| ----------------------------- |-------|
| Send         | Send amount from P1 to P2     | P1    |
| WaitForP1    |                               |       |
| Return       | Return amount from P2 to P1   | P2    |
| WaitForP2    |                               |       |
| Results      | Show Results                  | Both  |

. . . 

- We need to trigger `set_payoffs` in the `WaitForP2` page.

# Preparing Results Page
* We can have a single page with if conditions

```{.html filename="templates/trust/Results.html" code-line-numbers="false"}
    {{ if player.id_in_group == 1 }}
      <ul>
            <li> You had {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} </li>
            <li> You sent Player B {{ group.sent_amount }}.</li>
            <li> Player B returned {{ group.returned_amount }}. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    {{ else }}
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Player A sent you {{ group.sent_amount }}. </li>
                <li>You returned {{ group.returned_amount }}. </li>

            </ul>
            </p>
    {{ endif }}

```

## Payoff Relevant Variables in a Template {.smaller}
:::{.incremental}
* In oTree, there is a separate `player` object for each participant in each app or in each round.
* oTree represents a participant with `participant` object within all rounds and apps. 
* It tracks payoff relevant information for each round/each app and update `participant` variables
* Some important variables:
  * `participant.payoff`: Total payoff in each app in the currency/points
  * `participant.payoff_in_real_world_currency`: Total payoff after the payoff is converted
  * `participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee`: Payoff + participation fee
* You can access the participation fee by `session.config.participation_fee`
:::

## Payoff relevant information in Results
```{.html filename="templates/trust/Results.html" code-line-numbers="false"}
    <p>
        Your payoff from this stage is {{ participant.payoff }}. 
        It is converted to {{ participant.payoff_in_real_world_currency }}.
        You earned {{ session.config.participation_fee }} a fixed 
        show-up fee for participating in this experiment.
    </p>

    <h5>In total, your final earning 
    is {{ participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee }}. </h5>
```


## Easier definition of roles

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class C(BaseConstants):
    NAME_IN_URL = 'trust'
    PLAYERS_PER_GROUP = 3
    NUM_ROUNDS = 1

    TRUSTOR = 1
    TRUSTEE = 2
```

## Built-in Roles
- If you add `_ROLE` in constants, oTree will automatically create a `role` field in `player` object and fill it with the string you defined.

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class C(BaseConstants):
    # ...
    TRUSTOR_ROLE = 'Trustor'
    TRUSTEE_ROLE = 'Trustee
```

## Built-in Roles

Then one can write

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
class Return(Page):

    @staticmethod
    def is_displayed(player):
        return player.role == "Trustor"
```

## Also you can get player by role

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}
player1 = group.get_player_by_role("Trustor")
```
