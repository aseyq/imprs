## Individual Experiments

* We have covered individual experiments so far.
* Create `Player` fields for the variables written in the data

* Create `Pages` for each page we will see and add fields with `form_fields`

* Create/modify the templates for each page. (`PageName.html`, `AnotherPage.html`)

## Individual Experiments
![](images/model_page_template.png)


## Group Experiments
* **Homogenous Groups** 

  * All players have the same role.
  
  * They see the same pages.

* **Heterogenous Groups**

  * Players are in some set of roles.
  
  * They see different pages based on their roles.

## Homogenous Group Experiments {.smaller}

* Some technical aspects differ from the individual experiments:

| Aspect                     | Individual Task        | Group Task                                     |
| -----------------          | ------------------     | --------                                       |
| **Pages**                  | My own pace | Sometimes have to wait for others|
| **Variables / Calculations** | My own variables   | Need to reach other players' variables        |


## Waiting for other players

:::{.incremental}
* oTree has a specific type of page called "WaitPage"
* Waits for all players in the group. When everybody is thereo, it moves on to the next page. 
* You need to add it to `PageSequence` list at the bottom but you don't need to create a template.
* It can also trigger some functions when all players in the group reach to the point.
:::

## Wait Pages
* Syntax:
```{.python}
class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):
    pass
```

- You already get an example when you create a new app.

## oTree models
**`__init__.py`**:
```{.python}
# MODELS
class Constants(BaseConstants):
    name_in_url = 'my_survey'
    players_per_group = None
    num_rounds = 1


class Subsession(BaseSubsession):
    pass


class Group(BaseGroup):
    pass


class Player(BasePlayer):
    some_individual_variable = models.IntegerField()

```


# Models
* They are manage objects which represent players/groups/the constants and handle database entries.

* Four built-in models:
  * `Player`: Parameters that are unique for each individual.
  
  * `Group` : Parameters that are unique for the group, same for each individual in the group.
  
  * `Constants`: Parameters that are the same for the experiment.
     * Beware:Constants are not written on the data!
  
  * `Subsession`: Parameters that are same for the "subsession". More often used to initiate some specific settings. We will see it next week.

## Setting group size

* Groups structure is created and handled automatically by oTree

```{.python code-line-numbers="|2"}
class C(BaseConstants):
    NAME_IN_URL = 'pgg'
    PLAYERS_PER_GROUP = 3
    NUM_ROUNDS = 1
```

## `Player` and `Group` classes
- Remember, classes are like blueprints
- They are capitalized. (`Player`, `Group`)
  
- Instances of classes (objects) are not capitalized. (`player`, `group`)
- We deal with instances in computations.

![](images/classes.png)

## `Player` and `Group` classes
* They have some attributes(variables) 
    * Built-in or defined in the relevant model
    * Each player object holds its own value

* They have some built-in functions(methods) too

* We can also define top-level functions to interact with them.

* We can reach from one object to another.

![](images/classes.png)

## Reaching to players in a group
* Groups contain players
* `some_list = group.get_players()`
* That list contains players (remember the exercises)
* `some_list[0]`, `some_list[1]`, `some_list[2]`
* 
* We can loop over that:

```{.python code-line-numbers=false}
players = group.get_players()

for p in players:
  p.my_player_variable = some_value

```

# Building a Public Goods Game

## Creating a new app
1. `otree startapp pgg`
2. Add it to `settings.py`.

```{.python filename="settings.py" code-line-numbers="false"}
# ...
SESSION_CONFIGS = [
    dict(
        name='pgg',
        app_sequence=['pgg'],
        num_demo_participants=3,
    ),
]
# ...
```

## Let's plan first our pages
| Page           | Description       |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| `Contribution` | Contribute screen |
| `Results`      | Results screen    |

## We need a WaitPage before the calculations

| Page                  | Description       |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `Contribution`        | Contribute screen |
| **`ResultsWaitPage`** | Waiting page      |
| `Results`             | Results screen    |


## Fields {.smaller}

| Variable       | Model         | Type              |                              |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `contribution` | `Player`      | `CurrencyField()` | Player's contribution        |
| `ENDOWMENT`    | `C` Constants | Currency (`cu`)   | Initial endowment            |
| `MULTIPLIER`   | `C` C         | Integer           | Multiplier for contributions |

## Group Fields {.smaller}

- We should think of group fields as the variables that are the same for all players in the group.

- `total_contribution`
- `individual_share` (not strictly necessary but useful for a cleaner calculation)

## Fields {.smaller}

| Variable       | Model         | Type              |                              |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `contribution` | `Player`      | `CurrencyField()` | Player's contribution        |
| `payoff`       | `Player`      | `CurrencyField()` | Player's payoff              |
| `ENDOWMENT`    | `C` Constants | Currency (`cu`)   | Initial endowment            |
| `MULTIPLIER`   | `C` C         | Integer           | Multiplier for contributions |
| `total_contribution` | `Group` | `CurrencyField()` | Total contribution of the group |
| `individual_share` | `Group` | `CurrencyField()` | Individual share of the group |

## `Currency` and `payoff` built-in features in oTree

:::{.incremental}
* oTree has built-in currency field : `Currency`
* Handles monetary calculations and currency symbols.
* Each player has already a `payoff` field
* Payoff will be converted to real money at the end.
* `settings.py` controls the conversion rate.
* It has `USE_POINTS` and `REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE` variables.
:::

## Setting payoffs

- Again we will define `set_payoffs` function. (name is not important)
- But this time it will take `group` as an argument (as opposed to `player`)
- We will use `group` to reach to players in the group.

## Let's write `set_payoffs`
```{.python code-line-numbers=false}
def set_payoffs(group):
    print("my function set payoffs worked!")

    players = group.get_players()

    contributions = []

    for p in players:
        contributions.append(p.contribution)

    group.total_contribution = sum(contributions)

    group.individual_share = group.total_contribution * C.MULTIPLIER / C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP

    for p in players:
        p.payoff = C.ENDOWMENT - p.contribution + group.individual_share

```




## Triggering `set_payoffs`
- In the individal experiment, we triggered it by defining `before_next_page` function inside a page.

- This time we will trigger it from `ResultsWaitPage`.

## Triggering `set_payoffs` in a WaitPage

Option 1: Define a function and give the function name to `after_all_players_arrive` attribute.

```{.python}
class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):
    
    def after_all_players_arrive(group):
        set_payoffs(group)


```

Option 2: Just give the function name to `after_all_players_arrive` variable.

```{.python}
class ResultsWaitPage(WaitPage):
  after_all_players_arrive = set_payoffs
```

## Lets set the trigger in our ResultsWaitPage



## Template features

* Templates have access to `player`, `group` and `Constants` variables.

   ```
       Your guess was {{ player.guess }}.
       Your group decided on {{ group.decision }}
       The reward was {{ Constants.reward }}
       You will get {{session.config.participation_fee}} for participating.
   ```   
   
* You can show less digits of decimals with `| to0`, `|to1`, `|to2`.

## Let's write our templates

```{.html filename="Contribution.html"}
{{ block title }}
    Please decide on your contribution
{{ endblock }}
{{ block content }}

    Round: {{ player.round_number }}

    {{ formfields }}

    {{ next_button }}

{{ endblock }}
```

## Let's write our templates
```{.html filename="Results.html"}
{{ block title }}
    Results
{{ endblock }}


{{ block content }}
    <p> You contributed {{ player.contribution }} </p>
    <p> The total contribution was {{ group.total_contribution }} </p>
    <p> Each person got {{ group.individual_share }} from the group project </p>
    <p> And your final payoff was {{ player.payoff }} </p>

    {{ next_button }}
{{ endblock }}
```


## Practice 
- Create a new page called "Welcome" at the beginning of the game
- Set the title to "Welcome" and write a welcome message

Remember: Steps to create a new page:

- Create a new class that inherits from `Page`: `Welcome(Page)`
- Create a template file Welcome.html
- Add the page to `page_sequence`


## Assignment {.smaller}
Take the Public Goods Game we used. Do the following:

- Set the number of rounds to 3

- Add a Welcome page and add some welcome messages to it. Make it visible only on the first page (hint: look at the documentation for is_displayed)


## Assignment (.contd)

- Show the contributions of other players in the group (including or excluding myself) Hint:

  - Path 1: You can create a list of contributions and input it into the template. Then you need to check vars_for_template in the documentation.

  - Path 2: You can loop over the players in the group in the template. Check {{ for p in group.get_players }} in the documentation. This is the template version of group.get_players().




## Dislaying pages conditionally
* Built in method `is_displayed(player)` should be defined under the page class.
* This method should return `True` or `False` (or `None`)
* If this method returns `True` for current player, the page is displayed. Otherwise, it will not.

* If there are any calculations triggered by page, they will be skipped as well.

```{.python code-line-numbers=false}

class ScaryPage(Page):

    def is_displayed(player):
        return player.age > 18
    
```

## Dislaying pages conditional on the round number

- `player.round_number` is a built-in variable in oTree.
- Also available in `group` and `subsession`.
- Starts from 1.

```{.python code-line-numbers=false}
class Welcome(Page):

    def is_displayed(player):
        return player.round_number == 1
    
```

## Looping in templates

- You can loop over some iterables in the templates. (Very limited)
- One option is to loop over the players in the group.

```{.python code-line-numbers=false}
{{ for p in group.get_players }}
    Player {{ p.id_in_group }} contributed {{ p.contribution }}.
{{ endfor }}

```

```
Player 1 contributed 10 points. Player 2 contributed 30 points. Player 3  contributed 40 points.
```

## Looping in templates

- You can add a condition to note yourself.

```{.python code-line-numbers=false}
    {{ for p in group.get_players }}
        {{ if p == player }}
            You contributed {{ p.contribution }}.
        {{ else }}
            Player {{ p.id_in_group }} contributed {{ p.contribution }}.
        {{ endif }}
    {{ endfor }}
```

```
Player 1 contributed 10 points. Player 2 contributed 30 points. You contributed 40 points.

```

## Template features

* If you want to show a variable that are not in your fields, you can use a page function called `vars_for_template`

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}

class Results(Page):
    def vars_for_template(player):
        return dict(
            variable_to_show=432,
        )
```
  
* Then you can reach it in the template by:

```
{{ variable_to_show }}
```

## Template features

```{.python code-line-numbers="false"}

class Results(Page):
    def vars_for_template(player):
        other_players = player.get_others_in_group()
        other_contributions = [p.contribution for p in other_players]

        return dict(
            other_contributions=other_contributions
        )
```
  
* Then you can reach it in the template by:

```
{{ other_contributions }}

[ 10, 20 ]
```
