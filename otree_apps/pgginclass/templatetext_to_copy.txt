            You are about to contribute to the public project. You are playing in a group of <strong> {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} players (including you) </strong>.
            Each player has {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. You can contribute any amount between 0 and {{ C.ENDOWMENT }} to the public project
            The amount you contribute will be multiplied by {{ C.MULTIPLIER }} and added to the public project.
            The total amount in the public project will be divided equally among all the players in the group.
            In other words final payoff will be:
            
            {{C.ENDOWMENT}} - Your contribution + Total contribution in your group * {{ C.MULTIPLIER }} / {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}
